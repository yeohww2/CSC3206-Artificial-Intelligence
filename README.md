#Project Overview

This project simulates a Virtual World Treasure Hunt where an agent explores different states, collects treasures, and avoids unwanted objects like traps and obstacles. The goal is to collect all treasures using minimal energy.

Features
Agent Movement: The agent navigates through different states, collecting treasures and avoiding traps or obstacles.
Unwanted States: The agent encounters obstacles and traps, which are marked as unwanted and should be avoided to minimize energy usage.
Energy Calculation: The energy consumed during the agentâ€™s journey is calculated based on the steps taken between states.
Treasure Collection: The agent tracks the number of treasures collected throughout the path.
Uniform Cost Search (UCS): The search algorithm employed is UCS, which prioritizes nodes with the lowest energy cost.
